Overview

Welcome to the MDN "Local Library" Express (Node) tutorial, in which we develop a website that might be used to manage the catalog for a local library.

In this series of tutorial articles you will:

    Use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application.
    Start and stop the Node web server.
    Use a database to store your application's data.
    Create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
    Work with forms.
    Deploy your application to production.

You have learnt about some of these topics already, and touched briefly on others. By the end of the tutorial series you should know enough to develop simple Express apps by yourself.
